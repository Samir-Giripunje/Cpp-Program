Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. The only catch here is, that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited twice). To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array. A graph can have more than one DFS traversal.

Example: 

Input: n = 4, e = 6 
0 -> 1, 0 -> 2, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 0, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 3 
Output: DFS from vertex 1 : 1 2 0 3

Prerequisites:  See this post for all applications of Depth First Traversal.

Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

So the basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the path.

Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

Create a recursive function that takes the index of the node and a visited array.
Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with the index of the adjacent node.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:


// C++ program to print DFS traversal from
// a given vertex in a  given graph
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// Graph class represents a directed graph
// using adjacency list representation
class Graph {
public:
    map<int, bool> visited;
    map<int, list<int> > adj;
 
    // function to add an edge to graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w);
 
    // DFS traversal of the vertices
    // reachable from v
    void DFS(int v);
};
 
void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w)
{
    adj[v].push_back(w); // Add w to v’s list.
}
 
void Graph::DFS(int v)
{
    // Mark the current node as visited and
    // print it
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
 
    // Recur for all the vertices adjacent
    // to this vertex
    list<int>::iterator i;
    for (i = adj[v].begin(); i != adj[v].end(); ++i)
        if (!visited[*i])
            DFS(*i);
}
 
// Driver's code
int main()
{
    // Create a graph given in the above diagram
    Graph g;
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 0);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);
    g.addEdge(3, 3);
 
    cout << "Following is Depth First Traversal"
            " (starting from vertex 2) \n";
 
    // Function call
    g.DFS(2);
 
    return 0;
}
 
// improved by Vishnudev C
Output
Following is Depth First Traversal (starting from vertex 2) 
2 0 1 3 
Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Auxiliary Space: O(V), since an extra visited array of size V is required.

Handling A Disconnected Graph:
This will happen by handling a corner case. 

The above code traverses only the vertices reachable from a given source vertex. All the vertices may not be reachable from a given vertex, as in a Disconnected graph. To do a complete DFS traversal of such graphs, run DFS from all unvisited nodes after a DFS. The recursive function remains the same.

Follow the below steps to solve the problem:

Create a recursive function that takes the index of the node and a visited array.
Mark the current node as visited and print the node.
Traverse all the adjacent and unmarked nodes and call the recursive function with the index of the adjacent node.
Run a loop from 0 to the number of vertices and check if the node is unvisited in the previous DFS, then call the recursive function with the current node.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:


// C++ program to print DFS
// traversal for a given
// graph
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
class Graph {
 
    // A function used by DFS
    void DFSUtil(int v);
 
public:
    map<int, bool> visited;
    map<int, list<int> > adj;
    // function to add an edge to graph
    void addEdge(int v, int w);
 
    // prints DFS traversal of the complete graph
    void DFS();
};
 
void Graph::addEdge(int v, int w)
{
    adj[v].push_back(w); // Add w to v’s list.
}
 
void Graph::DFSUtil(int v)
{
    // Mark the current node as visited and print it
    visited[v] = true;
    cout << v << " ";
 
    // Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
    list<int>::iterator i;
    for (i = adj[v].begin(); i != adj[v].end(); ++i)
        if (!visited[*i])
            DFSUtil(*i);
}
 
// The function to do DFS traversal. It uses recursive
// DFSUtil()
void Graph::DFS()
{
    // Call the recursive helper function to print DFS
    // traversal starting from all vertices one by one
    for (auto i : adj)
        if (visited[i.first] == false)
            DFSUtil(i.first);
}
 
// Driver's  Code
int main()
{
    // Create a graph given in the above diagram
    Graph g;
    g.addEdge(0, 1);
    g.addEdge(0, 9);
    g.addEdge(1, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 0);
    g.addEdge(2, 3);
    g.addEdge(9, 3);
 
    cout << "Following is Depth First Traversal \n";
       
      // Function call
    g.DFS();
 
    return 0;
}
// improved by Vishnudev C
Output
Following is Depth First Traversal 
0 1 2 3 9 
Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
